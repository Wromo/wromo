## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Wromo project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Logo.wromo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tour.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.wromo
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Wromo looks for `.wromo` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory.
Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Wromo/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
