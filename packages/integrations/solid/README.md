# @wromojs/solid-js ðŸ’™

This **[Wromo integration][wromo-integration]** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) components.

## Installation

There are two ways to add integrations to your project. Let's try the most convenient option first!

### (experimental) `wromo add` command

Wromo includes a CLI tool for adding first party integrations: `wromo add`. This command will:
1. (Optionally) Install all necessary dependencies and peer dependencies
2. (Also optionally) Update your `wromo.config.*` file to apply this integration

To install `@wromojs/solid-js`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx wromo add solid
# Using Yarn
yarn wromo add solid
# Using PNPM
pnpx wromo add solid
```

If you run into any hiccups, [feel free to log an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/withwromo/wromo/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Install dependencies manually

First, install the `@wromojs/solid-js` integration like so:

```
npm install @wromojs/solid-js
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. Still, if you see a "Cannot find package 'solid-js'" (or similar) warning when you start up Wromo, you'll need to install SolidJS:

```sh
npm install solid-js
```

Now, apply this integration to your `wromo.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

__wromo.config.mjs__

```js
import solid from '@wromojs/solid-js';

export default {
  // ...
  integrations: [solid()],
}
```

## Getting started

To use your first SolidJS component in Wromo, head to our [UI framework documentation][wromo-ui-frameworks]. You'll explore:
- ðŸ“¦ how framework components are loaded,
- ðŸ’§ client-side hydration options, and
- ðŸª† opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

Also check our [Wromo Integration Documentation][wromo-integration] for more on integrations.
